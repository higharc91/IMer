                "Y88P"                   

**Installation**
1. If not on computer install python-2.7.5.msi found inside this folder.
	*linux comes pre-installed with python.
2.After installation if on windows double-click IMerMain.py
	*If on linux start up IDLE and run IMerMain.py in it, or in terminal type "python path/to/ImerMain.py
3.Sit back and wait whie Imer looks for a IM server, if found you will be asked to login, if not found you
  will become the sever, follow the instructions and leave the window up, and restart IMER.

**Thoughts**
Please keep in mind that this is a new program which has limitations.
In the future I hope to include;
1.Server_Scans accross various subnets
2.On-line mode(connections to hosted server if no LAN connection is possible)
3.**Most Importantly a GUI interface
